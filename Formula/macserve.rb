  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This installs the macserve and macserve-controller commands only; nothing is configured or started.
      Begin with the read-only preflight, run as yourself (not with sudo):
        macserve setup --plan
      Setup verifies the release SHA256SUMS before copying the binary into
      root-owned /Library/macserve/bin; these Homebrew copies are never the service.
